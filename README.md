# bkk-crawler-hq

This project is for downloading current weather data and route details from BKK - main public transportation company for Budapest.
Combine and serialize these 2 datasets into one what could be used for data science projects.

Fully implemented OpenWeatherMap API crawler for calls with geotags and multiple API endpoint crawler was created for BKK API.

This project was created for my University Thesis.
